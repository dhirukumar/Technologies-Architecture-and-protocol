### dual connectivity

-  dual connectivity :- dual connectivity is reffer to when your UE connect with two cell one is primary cell and another is sec cell 

  - primary cell is inportant for data rate and what type of service UE get
  - sec cell is inportant for

- We can have master node as 4G eNB that is connected to 4G core(EPC-Evolved packet core)

- Split bearer is the function that allows the split of data going to gNB from the core side into two paths

### Small cells in 5G networks

- Using dual connectivity it can connect to two cells which increases data rates.
  
-small cell coverage area 10 miter to 2k/m

- small cell is connected to macro cell

###  Increased wireless spectrum of 5G and its property

- Lower frequencies have less attenuation with excellent building penetration but have limited availibility
  
- Range of 6-100Ghz is what called mmWave but attenuation is much higgher as compared to other frequencies
OFDMA

- when we increse the frequency the coverage are less and the spectrum avlibality is higher

### OFDMA

- Orthogonal frequency division multiple access

- In OFDMA the frequency band in is divided into sub carriers

- the connection between UE and GnodB is called air interface

-  the space between two carrer subspacing is called def f

- flexible numerology is also know asscalable carrer spacing

- Flexible numerology is reffered by Î¼

- In case of 5G NR time is divided into FRAM which is space of 10 micro/sec

- IN case of 1 FRAM = 10 subfram with 1 micro/sec

- cyclic prefix= the time gap between one OFDM and another OFDM is know as cyclic prefix

- there are two type of cyclic prefix
    - normal
    - extended

- 1 slot=14 OFDM

### Resource Block and Resource elemment

- In 5G NR resource block is only defined in frequency domain and not in time domain having 12 consecutive block vertically
  
- In case of LTE resource block was defined in both frequency and time domains.

- As the spacing of sub carriers increased the duration of time slot is increased.

####  Resource elemment

- It is defined in both time and frequency domain

### Modulation in 5G
- QAM- Quadrature amplitude modulation
  
- When the distance between UE and tower increases and if there are obstacles between them, we need to downgrade the modulation scheme.
  
- For example
    - 16 QAM= 4 bits per symbol
    - 256 QAM= 8 bits per symbol, i.e it is defined in the power of 2

#### Cloud RAN

- latancy:- time taken to send a packet to recive packet is know as latency

- in cloud RAN DU is only is responsible for reciving/transmit the signal but all the process is held in CU
