# Standardiazation of 5G

- ITU-R(International telecommunicaiton union-Radiocommunication) is the body that holds responsibilitites to develop 5G and maintain the technical standard.
  
- IMT(International mobile telecommunications) are the requirements issued by ITU-R.

## Evolution to 5G
- GPRS was put as an add on to GSM network which provided speed of 50Kbps
