- 5G core network divided into many function as you see in this diagram
## 1st function

- AMF=It is very similar to MME in LTE (4G) or VLR in GSM(Global system for mobile communication)(2G)

- When a UE switch on then their first process to register with the network and this registration function is done by the AMF

- Before register in AMF you needs to authentication and this authentication is initiated by AMF weather this user is valid or not

- UE has always in two type of modes

   - Ideal mode:- in this mode UE register with network but UE not on call in that case the location of this UE is know to the network at the tracking area level

       - Tracking area:- the cell in the 5G network divided into the tracking area a group of cell has one tracking area and another group of cell has another tracking area

- So, when a UE in ideal mode and UE change there tracking area in this case UE needs to update their tracking area so this function is also handling by AMF

- When a  UE on call  in this case you will change their tracking area so you has also need to update there tracking area so this function is also handling by AMF

# authentication server function (AUSF)

## 2nd function

- When a UE want to register with AMF to make a call it needs to be authenticated and this authentication is initiated by AMF but in order to complete this authentication process to other entity are also needed one is UDM and another is AUSF

- Whenever AMF initiated the authentication process it basically send the identity of UE to AUSF and AUSF request UDM to generate the authentication vector this authentication vector generated by the UDM by the help of this identity of UE besed upon this secret key that is weather with the UDM after that authentication vector pass to the AUSF and it also pass this authentication vector to AMF

- Now with in this authentication vector there is a random number and AMF challenging the UE with the random number by sending it to the UE after receiving this authentication vector to UE  generate authentication response which goes to the AMF and pass on to the AUSF and AUSF check it is valid authentication response or not based upon that AUSF decision that whether this UE is authenticated or not
